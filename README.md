👨‍💻JaC Codes👨‍💻


ABOUT ME:

I am 22 years of age. I have been coding for around 7 months now. I first started of coding with Java and had an interest in the Spigot API. I made tons of progress very quickly. 
I started to take an interest in the backend side of development and was fascinated by how it all worked. I made a development case user signup/login system in Java which sent an automatated email to the users email address with their details. 
I used MySQL as the database. Then, I began learning the Spring Boot framework with Java and came across the Vaadin API for frontend. 
Following a tutorial, I made a clean enough and responsive frontend layout and began working on the backend. 
I used PostgreSQL for this project. Currently this project only has the registration side complete (with automated email) because, as I am a fairly new developer, 
I had some difficulty learning the spring boot concepts and putting it all together with user authentication. 
With a loss of motivation I decided it would be wise to take a break from Java and began a new journey learning a different language. 
I am now a month into learning JavaScript and the many libraries and environments like NodeJs and express. 
So far I have a semi functioning website (basic layout) with a signup/login which upon signing in the user is given a JWT, 
with an expiry date of 3 days, for the system to recognise the user is logged in. 
There is also a contact from which sends an automatic email with the field contents to the selected receipent.
This is currently as far as I have gotten as I lack the front end skills to develop the webpage more and implement features for when a user is signed in.
I am now in the process of continuing my JavaScript knowledge with the OOP concepts (Although having a good understanding of OOP in Java) and other JS concepts. 

In my spare time I am also learning AWS but this is very fresh so currently not much to mention.
